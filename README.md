# üìÇ **BeCode** - Mitnick 2: Projects Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the BeCode - Mitnick 2: Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly coding projects that I completed during my course at BeCode. The projects cover various domains, allowing me to build a solid foundation in programming and gain hands-on experience.

## Projects

This repository includes projects in the following domains:

1. **Bash Scripts**: Simple scripts written in Bash for various tasks.
2. **Python Scripts**: Python scripts exploring different concepts and use cases.
3. **Networking and administration**: Creating a simple LAN network with two endpoints (Windows & Linux machines), handled by Ubuntu Server (DHCP, DNS, MariaDB & Apache).
4. **PHP Scripts for Form Sanitizing**: PHP scripts for secure form data handling.

Feel free to explore each project's directory and find my code and insights about what I learned during the course.

## Contributing

As this repository primarily serves as a personal record of my learning journey, I'm not actively seeking contributions. However, feel free to open an issue if you'd like to share your thoughts or have any suggestions.

## License

You are welcome to explore the code and use it for personal and educational purposes.
